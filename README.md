# STRESS RELEASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The Stress Release Management System is a web-based platform designed to help users manage and alleviate stress using machine learning and personalized relaxation techniques. The system analyzes users' text inputs, such as their feelings or stress-related thoughts, to assess their stress levels. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the system categorizes users into different stress levels—low, medium, or high—based on the analysis of their input.

For users with mild stress, the system suggests interactive relaxation techniques such as games, puzzles, or breathing exercises. For those with more significant stress levels, the system recommends seeking professional help, such as consulting a doctor or therapist. The platform provides an intuitive, user-friendly interface that allows users to easily assess their stress and receive tailored recommendations.

Developed using Python, machine learning models, and NLP tools like Scikit-learn and NLTK, the system ensures that each recommendation is based on accurate data analysis. The web platform is built using Flask or Django for the backend and React/Next.js for the frontend, offering a seamless user experience. This system not only helps users manage stress but also promotes mental well-being by providing proactive, data-driven suggestions to manage and reduce stress levels effectively.
